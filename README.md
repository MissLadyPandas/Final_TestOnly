# Final_TestOnly

Final project test submission only 


The previous assignment for the Final Project required that you submit a document that included a class diagram document that used UML notation. By now (if not sooner), you should have a good idea of what classes you will need to include in your Java Application. You may, in fact, have identified additional classes you need to implement. For this assignment, you are to write the Java code for the classes that are required for the application (minimum of three).

Additionally, you will need to write test classes in order to test out the classes that can be used to test the functionality of your classes. These test classes should be maintained. For example, if you add a new method to one of your classes in a later part of the development of this Java app, you should account for this in your test classes. This will help verify that your classes still work!

Remember to use good programming style (including good use of comments).

Once your Classes/Test Classes are complete, you can submit the code through GitHub or a zipped file of your project folder. For GitHub, submit the URL of the repository for this assignment. For a zipped file, zip up your project folder then browse your computer, locate your zip file document, upload the zip file, and then click Submit Assignment again to complete.
